# SMART CLEANUP Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

The SMART CLEANUP feature has been successfully implemented in `/home/usuario/proyectos/webssh/server/terminal.js`. This new approach:

1. **Preserves Command History**: Unlike the previous RADICAL CLEANUP that removed all content except the last prompt, SMART CLEANUP keeps all executed commands and their output.

2. **Removes Only Duplicate Prompts**: The algorithm detects consecutive prompts without any content between them and removes these duplicates.

3. **How it works**:
   - Finds all prompts in the terminal buffer using regex patterns
   - Checks if there's content (commands/output) between prompts
   - Keeps prompts that have content after them
   - Removes prompts that are immediately followed by another prompt
   - Maintains a buffer size limit of 8KB to preserve more history

## Code location:
- File: `/home/usuario/proyectos/webssh/server/terminal.js`
- Function: `getTerminalBuffer()` (lines 135-215)
- Key sections:
  - Pattern matching for prompts (lines 143-162)
  - Smart cleanup logic (lines 166-207)

## To test:
1. The server is currently running with the SMART CLEANUP implementation
2. Create a new session and execute several commands
3. Refresh the page multiple times
4. You should see:
   - All your command history is preserved
   - Only one prompt appears at the bottom
   - No duplicate prompts accumulate

## Logs:
When restoration happens, you'll see messages like:
```
[SMART CLEANUP] Terminal <id>: found X prompts in Y bytes
[SMART CLEANUP] Cleaned buffer: Z prompts, W bytes
```

The implementation directly addresses your question: "¿Es que es factible que se muestre la información de ejecuciones de comandos que había hecho antes de actualizar la página?" - Yes, it is now feasible and implemented!
